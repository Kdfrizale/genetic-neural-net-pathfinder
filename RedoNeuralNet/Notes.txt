how to save best NeuralNet or all neural nets

combine test() and display()..by adding bool parameter which determines if it should save moves or not/ if it calculates fitness or not

add way to detect if ai just moves up, then down || right then left ///It is stuck in loop
	//in addition, if it does make a repeated move... make it choose the 2nd best option or something else... dont make it just stop/////ONLY  DO THIS IF THE BEST NET STILL INCORPARATES THIS FEATURE
